      <h2>Our Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Our food truck started as a dream to bring the vibrant and rich flavors of South India to the streets of Tübingen. 
        What began as a humble venture quickly grew into a beloved culinary experience. 
        We, Alok and Prathi, are passionate about sharing the authentic tastes of our heritage, 
        using authentic, traditional recipes that have been around for generations, optimized to fit our tastes exactly.
        From the tangy tamarind to the aromatic curry leaves, each dish is a celebration of our culture and our love for food.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are proud to offer a menu that reflects the diversity of South Indian cuisine, from crispy dosas to spicy sambars, 
        and we invite you to join us on this flavorful journey. Thank you for being part of our story!

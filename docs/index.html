        <h1>Welcome to Our Food Truck!</h1>
        <p>
           If you're in the mood for some authentic and delicious South Indian food in TÃ¼bingen,
           you will typically find us during lunch hours <b>every Wednesday at Technologiepark</b> and <b>every Thursday at Morgenstelle</b>.
           For a more detailed overview of when you can find us where (or in case you want to
           <a href="contact.html">book us</a> for your own event), have a look at the <a href="events.html">calendar</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our menu constantly evolves and is subject to availability, so sometimes we might have to make some last minute changes,
            but we try to keep this page up to date and you can check our <a href="menu.html">menu</a>
            to see if anything tickles your fancy and to get in the right mood! (:
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any questions, are looking for some catering or just want to have little chat,
            do not hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> and we'll get back to you as quickly as we can.
